	<h1>Samsungs new design</h1>
	<p class="additional">While AT&T and Verizon have already teased the 5G arrival of the Galaxy S10 ‘Beyond X’, confusion reigns about the all-new design Samsung has planned. Thanks to a historically reliable contact, I believe I now know the answer…  

Working with popular case maker Ghostek (which has previously supplied me with what proved to be accurate pre-release renders of the iPhone XR, twice, and Galaxy S9), I have now attained a render of the Galaxy S10. This is not to be confused with the new flat-screen entry-level S10 or the larger Galaxy S10+ and six-camera sporting Beyond X. But this is expected to be the model most customers will buy./p>

	<h1>Dell goes public again</h1>
	<p class="additional">Dell Technologies is going public again, five years after going private to transform itself amid slowing personal computer sales. Dell has certainly changed in those years, but it needs to change even more if it doesn't want to find itself back in the same position.
